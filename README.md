This is a .NET 8 Blazor Web application that works as an UI for [Phoenix Server](https://phoenix.acinq.co/server)

It's also a PWA application so you can install it from your web browser.

It's avalible for ARM64, ARMv7 and AMD64 architecture, see packages to determine which to pull.

To use this application you need to add a appsettings.json file that should contain the below.
Place the appsettings.json file at a suitable place and relate to the file path in the next step.
```
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Information",
            "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "PhoenixApi": {
        "BaseUrl": "http://ip-to-Phoneix-server:port",
        "Password": "password-to-phoneix-server"
    }
}
```
To run the application, use below command but replace /path/on/host/appsettings.json with the path to your appsettings.json
```
**Example to run. Change according to version and hash**

docker pull ghcr.io/hodladi/hodladiwallet/hodlwallet:main-caxxxx-axxxx

docker run -v /path/on/host/appsettings.json:/app/appsettings.json -p 5799:5799
```
This will start the container and the application will listen to port 5799 in a browser.
